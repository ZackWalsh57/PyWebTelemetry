#Calculate the Average for each indexed value by adding to itself and dividing by the itteration counter
#BUG: This method may not work.... It seems as though it is averaging the previous average and 
#the next seen value.  
#   The average of 5,10,5,15 assuming there are 4 itterations = 8.75
#   The average of 8.75 and the next value of 10 at 5 itterations = 3.75
#   The average of 5,10,5,15,10 at 5 itterations = 9.0
#   If this was going to work, all of the averages should be the same.
#   The program should work like this:
#       It needs to take all of the vlaues it's seen in the past and add them. THEN divide by the itterations.
#       The problem I'm going to have is that the sum of all the previous values may cause me an overflow error.
#       So for now, the averages will be disabled. I could update them less frequently but then I don't have an 
#       accurate number.  
'''AVERAGES[INDEX_PLACE] = ((AVERAGES[INDEX_PLACE] + VALUE) / ITTERATIONS)'''
